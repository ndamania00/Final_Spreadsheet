Design critique:

The model and controller design are very straight forward and do not have any unuseful methods
that would make an impossible or useless implementation. Our design choices where also very
similar which accounted for a fairly straightforward implementation of the model and controller.
The view code is not quite as intuitive as the model and view since they had a separate
class for drawing the sheet. I can see, however, that the idea behind that design is to minimize 
the duplicate code for creating the same JFrame over and over for different views.
Overall the group did a really good job with providing us a very well designed code.

Implementation critique:

The only critique, in my opinion, comes from modifying the Coord class with two additional methods
which made it necessary to ask for their code of the Coord class implementation because otherwise we
would not have been able to run the view.

Documentation critique:

The provided JavaDoc and README were very helpful in understanding the design choices that where
being made. There is nothing to complain about.

Design/code limitations and suggestions:

I don't see any limitations in the provided design but I think it would not have been necessary
to modify the Coord class. I can understand that it was convenient for their implementation 
but can make it more difficult for us if we don't know about it.


In general, we were very happy with the code given to us. All interfaces were very flexible the 
documentation very straight forward to understand and it very easy to reuse. It is also worth mentioning 
that they did a great job communicating with us. For every question we had they responded
withing a few minutes which sufficient information which allowed for an effortless workflow during 
the implementation process.
